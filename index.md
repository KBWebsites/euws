<!-- In the year 2001 some youths from Dibrugarh formed a society **EDUCATED UNEMPLOYED WELFARE SOCIETY** with a view to struggle with the problems of the unemployed youths of the region and assist them in various income generating projects and in other ways. -->

**EDUCATED UNEMPLOYED WELFARE SOCIETY** is a charitable institution and is working for the welfare of the people of Assam with special care to the youths since 2001. It is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 as well as u/s 12A & u/s 80G of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which means donation to the Society is exempt from income-tax in the hands of the donors under the Income-tax Act, 1961. It is also registered u/s 6(1)(a) of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 with the Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi. The main objective of the Society is to serve the ailing mankind without any self-interest and create a society where everybody has his/her own source of living with dignity and self respect.

The basic objective of **EUWS** is about creating more self reliance and independency in people with an aim towards providing sustainable livelihood opportunities to the society. In this direction it is conducting various kinds of Entrepreneurship & Skill Development Programmes (ESDP) on Desktop Publishing (DTP), Computer Hardware & Networking, Tally, Mobile & TV Repairing, Handicrafts, Beauty Care, Life Skill, Horticulture etc. in association with Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship, Guwahati an organization under the Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India. The direct beneficiaries of the trainings are the educated unemployed youths of the region. The trainings involve improving existing skills, technological interventions, technological up-gradations, designing, product development, practice and production. All such trainings are always backed by entrepreneurship development training programme, marketing training and management trainings, which makes the trainee self sustainable. Special easy to use manuals are developed for easy guidance and reference of the trainees. Moreover, the social responsibility to the society by the way of serving free to the people and nature is one of the mottos of the organisation.

We at **EUWS** believe in the fact that helping is not simply a matter of dispersing money but of making a deep, long-term commitment and casting a hard eye on results. With this view in mind, we are trying in capacity building, training the youths to gradually sustain and scale up themselves and their activities. The entire management and operation of **EUWS** is in compliance with the principles of "Good Governance" and thus sets itself apart with its set norms of sustainability, scalability, accountability, transparency, credibility and effective leadership.

**EUWS** is slowly moving from welfare to integrated age care services for the elderly in urban & rural areas expanding its scope of services quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Our strength lies in our honesty, dedication, approach, transparency and efficient and committed body of members. We sincerely look forward for an opportunity from your end to serve the society better. Any act of your kindness will go a long way in helping the ailing society.
